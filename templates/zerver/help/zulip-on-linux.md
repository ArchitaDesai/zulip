# Using Zulip on Linux

Zulip on the Linux desktop is even better than Zulip on the web,
with a cleaner look, native notifications, and support for multiple Zulip accounts.
For download instructions, go to the
[desktop app installation guide](https://zulipchat.com/help/desktop-app-install-guide#linux).


## Initial setup

### Connecting to a server

When you open the Zulip desktop app for the first time, a screen asking
for your server's or organization's address will appear.
You have to write the server's URL in it, and press **Save**.

!!! warn ""
    **Note:** There's no need to add `https://` in case your server is running a secure
    HTTP (HTTPS) protocol.

    However, if your server uses an insecure HTTP connection, you'll have to
    write `http://` manually before the server's URL. A message will appear,
    warning you about the risks
    of using this type of connections. In case you have no other choice, choose the
    **Use HTTP** option.

### Logging in

After connecting to the server, you'll be able to log in either with an email
address and a password, or using your Google or GitHub account.

* If you decide to log in with an email/password combination, enter your email
address in the **Email** field and your password in the **Password** field,
then press **Sign in**.
* If you prefer to log in with your Google or GitHub account,
then press the **Sign in with Google** or **Sign in with GitHub** button.

To add another organization or server that you're part of,
select (+) icon from the left sidebar
and you can add the URL same way you did before.
